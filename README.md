# RetroGuessr
Like GeoGuessr, but with time. Made by Joey Langhorst and Brian Yngve for the 2022 PackHacks Hackathon for the Retro Rewind track.

## SETUP:
- Ensure Python 3, beautifulsoup4 and requests modules are installed
- Run src/gameGUI.py from the repository directory (this can be done by running the gameGUI file in VSCode)

## HOW TO PLAY:
RetroGuessr tests your knowledge of global events from the 1970s to the 2000s from a broad variety of categories including world events, US politics, sports, and culture. When the game starts, you are prompted with a random headline selected from the New York Times archive. Select a year from the drop down menu and press "Guess!". If you are incorrect, another headline from the same year will appear. On a correct guess, the URLs to each article will be revealed. Click "New Articles" to generate a new game.

## OPTIONS:
If the articles you're given are particularly difficult, click on the Options tab and select Show Hints. This will tell you if your guesses are too early or too late.

## LEADERBOARD:
When you win a game, your score is recorded on the leaderboard. Click the Leaderboard tab to view your past scores.
